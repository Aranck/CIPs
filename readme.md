# CESS Improvement Protocol
The CESS Improvement Protocol contains the set of fundamental governing principles for the Filecoin Network. It outlines the vision for Filecoin and the principles, processes, and parties involved in making decisions that affect the future of the network. It also describes how improvements to these rules can be proposed and ratified.

# Mission
The goal of the CIP project is to document standardized protocols for CESS clients and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.


# The  Role of CIPs
CESS Improvement Proposals (FIPs) are the primary mechanism by which the CESS enthusiasts can submit, discuss, and approve changes relevant to the CESS network. These discussions and decisions should be guided by the governance and design principles above.

Cess is a key link in Polkadot ecology. It can not only provide elastic and scalable storage for the whole Polkadot ecology, but also provide friendly storage services for other ecological blockchain applications. At present, CIPS is not very perfect. We are gradually soliciting good ideas from the community. Once adopted, we will give rich returns.
